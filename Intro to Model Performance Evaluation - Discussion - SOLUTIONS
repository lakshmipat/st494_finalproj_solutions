Lesson Discussion
Share your experiences with the hands-on exercises. Discuss the results and the implications of different threshold values, ROC and PR curves, and AUC values.
		
“During the hands-on exercises, we experimented with different threshold values for the classification model and observed the trade-offs between false positives
and false negatives. We also generated both ROC and PR curves for a binary classification problem and compared the AUC values to analyze the model's performance. 
The exercises provided valuable insights into how varying thresholds and using different evaluation techniques can impact the model's performance.” -Dhari 
		
“The results of the exercises demonstrated that the choice of threshold value directly affects the balance between false positives and false negatives.
In some problem contexts, minimizing false positives might be more important than minimizing false negatives, or vice versa. This implies that selecting an
appropriate threshold value is crucial for maximizing the chosen performance metric or achieving a desirable balance between false positives and false 
negatives.” -Lakshmi

“ROC and PR curves, along with their AUC values, help us visualize and quantify the model's ability to differentiate between classes. The ROC curve is more 
informative when the classes are balanced or when the costs of false positives and false negatives are similar. In contrast, the PR curve is more informative 
when the classes are imbalanced or when the costs of false positives and false negatives are significantly different. By comparing AUC values, we can assess 
the overall performance of the model and make informed decisions about model selection and optimization.” -Esha

Brainstorm potential real-world applications where the choice of evaluation technique and performance metric is particularly critical. Discuss the factors to consider when making these choices.
“Medical diagnostics: In medical diagnostic tasks, such as predicting the presence of a disease, the cost of false negatives (failing to detect the disease)
can be significantly higher than the cost of false positives. In such cases, prioritizing sensitivity (recall) over precision might be critical, and using 
the PR curve for evaluation might be more appropriate.” -Dhari

“Fraud detection: In financial fraud detection, false positives (flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent) can lead to customer
dissatisfaction, while false negatives (failing to detect actual fraud) can result in financial losses. The choice of evaluation technique
and performance metric should be based on the balance between these costs and the prevalence of fraud in the data.” -Lakshmi

“Spam email filtering: In this context, false positives (filtering legitimate emails as spam) can be more costly than false negatives
(letting spam emails through). The evaluation technique and performance metric should focus on minimizing false positives while maintaining
an acceptable level of false negatives.” -Esha

*In each of these applications, it's important to consider the specific problem context, the balance between classes, and the costs of false
positives and false negatives when choosing evaluation techniques and performance metrics.
